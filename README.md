# I.O. Mod
I.O. Mod is an intuitive planner based on the concept of a module, a digital 'section' containing the details of a personal event or scheduled reminder. Differing interactions (swipes) with the module will allow you to complete different functions. At the consumer's discretion, I.O. Mod can also generate daily/weekly/monthly/annual activity reports to extend their grasp on managing their schedule.
